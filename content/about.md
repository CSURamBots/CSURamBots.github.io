# Project Summary
RAMbots is an extension of the ECE Outreach team responsible for gaining interests in STEM through the medium of robotics. This year's design will entail an open-source quadrupedal robot that will be similar in functionality with the Boston Dynamic SpotÂ®. The intent is to make a high quality, modular, and open-source design that can act as an alternative to leading industry robotic platforms. The goal is to use this platform so others can have a comparable open-source design to build projects and spark interests in robotics and STEM.
