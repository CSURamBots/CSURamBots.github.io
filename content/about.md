# Project Summary
RAMbots is an extension of the ECE Outreach team responsible for gaining interests in STEM through the medium of robotics.
This year's design will entail an open-source quadrupedal robot that will be similar in functionality with the Boston Dynamic SpotÂ®.
The intent is to make a high quality, modular, and open-source design that can act as an alternative to leading industry robotic platforms.
The goal is to use this platform so others can have a comparable open-source design to build projects and spark interests in robotics and STEM.

# Background

As a collaborative effort with the ECE Outreach team, this project aims to work as a continuation to help future generations of senior design engineers to have something to work with, improve upon, and show off to get students of all ages interested in stem.
The team wants to have something amazing to show that will instantly inspire others.
Realizing that many of the current market offerings are prohibitively expensive, we also aim to make this as in-expensive and as easy to set up as possible.

# Constraints

The main plan project plan is to design and build a Robotic Ram controlled by a Raspberry Pi 4B, as well as several other microcontrollers and accelerators.
The robotic ram will also include custom actuators, cameras, and will be almost entirely 3D printed.
The robotic ram will be based off of two different quadruped robots; our plan is to upsize the robot based on the two designs and get the robot to at least be able to walk on it's four legs.

# Goals
Our goals of the project consist of two goals separated between the first and second semester.

In the first semester we aim to plan, develop and build the robot.
We aim to have parts ordered by which we can then start building the robot and power it.
We also plan to begin programming simple and independent objectives.
If we reach this preliminary goal before the end of the semester, we can search for errors that we expect to come across before entering the second semester.

In the second semester if we can get past the construction stage, we can start integrative programming; a major goal is to get the robot to stand and walk.
Since we want this project to be open source, we want to include all of the CAD files, list of parts, and code on our project website for anyone to see and use by the end of the semester.
We also aim to implement machine learning algorithms for the robot in order for the robot to have a personality as well as put a camera on the robot for human facial recognition.
